This is the Planning Log
It will contain my plans for each part of the development
I will aslo try and pinpoint mistakes I made during planning in this file

Part 1 (16/05/2024)

First, I want to create a user system and basic interface. It will contain the following parts:
1. UserContainer
2. User object
3. Interface object
4. LogIn window
5. Hello window
6. UserProfile window

Detailed plan:

1. User container will store users locally
2. User object will store chat history, chat keys, username, user photo, and user id.
3. Interface will spawn windows inside of itself, and be centered on main camera. Should be able to scale to device display size
4. LogIn window - spawns two input lines for username and password. If there is a match, then loads user. If something is wrong will spawn error message. Should allow to create a new user
5. Hello window - shows greeting animation
6. UserProfile window - shows and allows to edit username, allows to edit password, allows to edit user photo, allows to log out.
